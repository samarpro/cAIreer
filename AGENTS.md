# Project collaboration

The project owner is learning software engineering while building this product.

Read `TECH-MAP.md` before making architectural, dependency, service-boundary, or deployment decisions. Keep it aligned with the implementation.

For implementation, architecture, debugging, and code-review work, use the installed `learn-by-building` skill when available. Default to Guided shipping: keep product progress moving while teaching one transferable concept per slice and giving the owner a meaningful decision, prediction, test, explanation, or small implementation.

Read `.learning/mission.md` and `.learning/profile.md` before selecting teaching depth. Do not mark a capability as demonstrated merely because an agent implemented or explained it.

Codex owns maintenance of the custom learning experience. It should proactively refine the `learn-by-building` skill, learning-state structure, roadmap, exercises, and teaching approach when project evidence shows an improvement is needed. Explain material changes to the owner. Do not make the owner maintain teaching infrastructure unless they explicitly want to contribute to it.

# AGENTS.md

Every rule here must change behavior. Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.

## 1. Match the process to the task

### Quick questions

Answer explanations, reviews, and read-only questions directly. Do not create `PLAN.md`, ask for approval, or use subagents unless asked.

### Small changes

For a contained, low-risk change, briefly state what you will change, then do it. Ask first only when the request is ambiguous, destructive, or requires a product decision.

### Long tasks

Treat work as long when it involves multiple components, a migration or substantial refactor, material risk, or several independent workstreams.

Before editing:

1. Describe the intended outcome in 2–3 sentences.
2. Wait for my approval.
3. Create or update `PLAN.md`.
4. List each implementation step and the check that will prove it works.

Read-only inspection is allowed before approval. After approval, continue through normal implementation and verification without repeatedly asking permission.

Keep `PLAN.md` current. If work pauses, leave enough context for a new session to continue.

After two failed attempts at the same step, stop. Record both failures in `PLAN.md`, reassess the cause, and replace the failed approach before continuing.

## 2. Make the smallest change that works

Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.

- Stay inside the requested scope.
- When choosing between approaches, weigh:
  - UX for the user
  - DX for the next developer
  - AX for the next agent
- Before deleting or replacing material work, confirm it is recoverable. Git history is enough for tracked files. Back up untracked or non-versioned files.

## 3. Use subagents when they help

Use subagents for long tasks with independent work that can run safely in parallel. Do not use them for quick questions or tightly coupled edits.

Available roles:

- Explorer: inspects and reports. Does not edit.
- Worker: implements one defined part.
- Reviewer: checks the result and reports. Never edits.
- Educator: creates artifacts based on learnigs in the session. Uses quiz system to test info first.

For each subagent:

1. Give it one job.
2. State the done condition.
3. Require a report of no more than five lines.

Do not assign two agents to edit the same file at the same time. Verify any key claim from a subagent before relying on it.

## 4. Own the bug

- Reproduce the bug using my steps before changing code.
- If reproduction fails, report what happened and what information is missing.
- Fix the cause, not the visible symptom.

Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.

## 5. Verify before saying done

- Run the checks affected by the change and read their output.
- For UI changes, open the UI and test the changed flow, including empty input, repeated submission, and refresh when relevant.
- State which checks were not run. An unrun check is not a pass.
- Finish with a concise report covering (when asked only):
  - what changed
  - what was verified
  - what tradeoff was accepted and why
  - what I can learn


## 6. Record corrections

When I correct your working method, add a reusable lesson below in this form:

> When X, do Y.

Put the newest lesson first. If the same mistake happens again, rewrite the lesson so it gives clearer direction.

Ask before changing any section above `Lessons`.

## Lessons

- When implementing a capability, check for and reuse existing functionality before creating a new implementation. If it cannot meet the requirement, explain why before replacing or duplicating it.

- When a Python project needs a provider SDK, check the provider's Python package before introducing a JavaScript bridge.

- When adding model evaluation, confirm the requested SDK and provider route before adding dependencies or requesting provider credentials.

- When proposing changes to an instruction file, show the full draft before asking to apply it.
